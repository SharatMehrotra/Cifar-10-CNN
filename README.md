# Cifar-10-CNN
CNN model using 3 VGG layers trained on the Cifar-10 data set.

Using 3 layers of the VGG CNN model along with dropout layers, we have trained the CNN on the Cifar-10 dataset.<br>
We observed that batch normalization improves the performance from 82 to 83.83%.
The model finally achieved a test accuracy of 83.83%.
